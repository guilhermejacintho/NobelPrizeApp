# NobelPrizeApp
Application to retrieve some Nobel Prize information

To execute by console, you can call only the application: '.\NobelPrizeApp.exe'or you can pass directly the file to process like '.\NobelPrizeApp.exe 'c:\yourfilepath\yourfiletext.txt'
There is no loop to retry the file to process, if it is not informed or with errors, you have to rerun the app with the correct file path.
